<h1>The Best Movies According to Troy</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Iron Man</h3>
<p>This is the movie about my most favorite superhero.  It was also the beginning of the Marvel Universe.</p>
<h3>Empire Strikes Back</h3>
<p>This was the first Star Wars movie I saw when I was kid.  I was so caught up in this movie that I cried when Luke's hand was cut off.</p>
<h3>Alien</h3>
<p>This movie was the first of its genre.  I had never been more scared during a movie than this one.  Its sequel "Aliens" was equally captivating.</p>
